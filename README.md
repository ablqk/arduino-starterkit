# Arduino Starter Kit with TinyGo

Learn the Arduino basics, but replace the C in the book with the Go language. Because it's simple and modern and fun.

## What is this?

### The Arduino Starter Kit

> Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.
>
> Over the years Arduino has been the brain of thousands of projects, from everyday objects to complex scientific

## Set up

You need Go, TinyGo and the special AVR dude.

- Install Go. The latest version is not yet supported by TinyGo. Namely, I am using Go 1.17 for TinyGo 0.22.0
- [Install TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/install).
- If you are using Unix, scroll down to
  the [AVR packages](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/install/linux/#avr-eg-arduino-uno-2) that you need for Arduino
  Uno.
